## Project Notes

- In exercise 1 we had difficulties in understanding how the tracks should be built dinamicaly, but once we understood them, exercise 1 was very fast to figure out and finish.
- In exercise 2 we had some help from the teacher in understanding the circle building part, but once that was out of the way, the rest of the modeling was pretty simple.
- In exercise 3 we had no issues whatsoever in building the cube.
- In exercise 4 we really struggled for quite a while, but again, we just needed a single pointer as an example to get us going. Once we understood the animation concept it was fast to develop the necessary things.
- In exercise 5 we were able to animate the crane according to the key presses, but we were unable to implement the pickup/drop the package mecyhanism.
- In exercise 6 we had no major issues.
- In exercise 7 we were able to implement the rotation of the wheels in function of the velocity of the train.
